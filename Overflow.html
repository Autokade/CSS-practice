    <!--The overflow property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.

The overflow property has the following values:

visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary-->
    <h2>Overflow: visible</h2>

    <p>
      By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it
      renders outside the element's box:
    </p>

    <div>
      You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of
      the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
      overflows an element's box.
    </div>
    <h2>Overflow: scroll</h2>

    <p>
      Setting the overflow value to scroll, the overflow is clipped and a
      scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box. Note that this will add a
      scrollbar both horizontally and vertically (even if you do not need it):
    </p>

    <div class="scroll">
      You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of
      the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
      overflows an element's box.
    </div>
    <!--The auto value is similar to scroll,
         but it adds scrollbars only when necessary:-->
    <h2>Overflow-x and overflow-y</h2>

    <p>
      You can also change the overflow of content horizontally or vertically.
    </p>
    <p>
      overflow-x specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content.
    </p>
    <p>
      overflow-y specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content.
    </p>

    <div class="overflowx">
      You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of
      the layout. The overflow property specifies what happens if content
      overflows an element's box.
    </div>
    <!--overflow	Specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box
