    <!--CSS Word Wrapping
The CSS word-wrap property allows long words to be able to be broken and wrap onto the next line. 

If a word is too long to fit within an area, it expands outside:

This paragraph contains a very long word: thisisaveryveryveryveryveryverylongword. The long word will break and wrap to the next line.

The word-wrap property allows you to force the text to wrap - even if it means splitting it in the middle of a word:

This paragraph contains a very long word: thisisaveryveryveryveryveryverylongword. The long word will break and wrap to the next line.

The CSS code is as follows:-->
    <h1>The word wrap property</h1>
    <p class="test">
      This paragraph contains a very long word:
      thisisaveryveryveryveryveryverylongword. The long word will break and wrap
      to the next line.
    </p>



    <h1>The word-break Property</h1>

<p class="test3">This paragraph contains some text. This line will-break-at-hyphens.</p>

<p class="test4">This paragraph contains some text. The lines will break at any character.</p>
